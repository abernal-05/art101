                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I made some syntanx errors when linking my CSS file. "div class=" Instead of "div id=". </p>

                    <h2>Lab 12</h2>
                    <image class="lab12" src="img/dblab12.png"/><image class="lab12-output" src="img/lab12-output.png"></image>
                    <p>Instead of using "div class='output'" I used "div id='class'”, which didn’t match my JavaScript code. 
                    Part of the sorting function is appending a string to the “output” section. 
                    In my function I used jQuery to call an id, but “output” was originally a “class” in my faulty code. 
                    I saw in my console that my JavaScript was running, 
                    but since I made an error in my HTML the string made from the sorting function wasn’t printed in my “output” section. </p>
                    <h2>Lab 13</h2>
                    <image class="lab13-1" src="img/db-lab13-1.png"></image><image class="lab13-2" src="img/db-lab13-2.png"></image>
                    <image class="lab13-output" src="img/lab13-output.png"></image>
                    <p>I went back and watched the lecture on loops to get the JavaScript from the JS Bin activity.
                         Afterwards I messed around with making the i variable user input.
                          I have yet to make the text print user input as well though. 
                          I also didn’t want my output to stack so I created a button that hides the output section. 
                          Some errors I ran into while writing this code has syntax errors, specifically mistakes in capitalization.</p>
