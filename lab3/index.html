			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab tests our familiarity with file structures and transfers. Throughout this lab we have to create files and reference them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble putting links to other pages in my lab. I solved this by looking back at the lecture notes to identify what code I was missing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a bit difficult at time, as I was constantly referencing lecture slides to become more familiar with referencing links in HTML. Looking back at the slides as I completed this assignment made me more confident in file structure and transfer.</p>
